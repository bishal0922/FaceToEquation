# FaceToEquation

User uploads an image of their face
Simple drag & drop or file select interface
Show preview of uploaded image

System detects face and generates initial outline
Interactive preview showing:

    - Original image
    - Generated outline overlay

Customization controls:
    - Slider for outline detail level (fewer/more points)
    - Ability to adjust outline complexity
    - Option to toggle between different mathematical approaches (polynomials, trigonometric functions, etc.)


Equation Generation & Visualization

    - Display generated equations in a clean, readable format
    - Show live graph of the equations
    - Allow copying equations to clipboard
    - Basic graph controls (zoom, pan)
